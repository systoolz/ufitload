Unifit 2001-2006 installer for modern OS and portable loader



This is Unifit modern systems portable installer and loader. Supported (tested) with Unifit versions from 2001 till 2006 inclusive (see below for archived download links). After installation Unifit will be portable and can be run from anywhere (for example even from removable USB flash drive) but you need to run software by pressing "Start" button on this window or it won't work otherwise.

Should work but not tested with Unifit 2007, please contact if you have original distributive for this version. Thank you.




Build with GCC 3.2 (mingw special 20020817-1) from DEV-CPP 4.9.8.0 (2003). Pure C and Win32API application, no GMO required (like msvcrt.dll, .NET Framework, Visual Studio Redistributable and so on). Should work anywhere starting from Windows 98.
